## OPTICS
We implemented the basic OPTICS as described by [wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPTICS_algorithm). The OPTICS is claimed to have better performance than the DBSCAN with more natural clusters generated while solving the leading drawback of DBSCAN, at the cost of more complicated parameter setting.
