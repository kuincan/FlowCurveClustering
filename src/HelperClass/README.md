## HelpClass
Inside this folder, it includes many valuable implementations for pre-processing or post-processing of quantitatively concluding the clustering results on different simularity measures,

- The time-based sampling method for **blood flow** to make sure that all the points along blood flow pathlines are rigorously at the same time step starting from the beginning
- The blood flow data set after time-based sampling, which has exactly the same geometric information to the original pathlines
- C++ code to re-calculate the clustering evaluation metrics by reading from the clustering result 
- The python script to fetch the evaluation metrics and calculation time 
- The nonlinear code to map and calculate the clustering evaluation metrics
- The R visualization code for ranking-based circle mapping
- The Shell script to perform all the calculation, visualization and conclusion for the clustering evaluation
- The python script to conclude the finalized clustering results for all the streamlines/pathlines
