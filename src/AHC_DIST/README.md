## AHC with distance threshold
- It is very similar to [BIRCH](../Birch/README.md) which accepts a distance threshold and will merge all candidates into one group within this distance threshold. 
- It has not been applied to flow visualization and the intuition of implementing it is to compare the clustering result to that by Birch
- The implementation can be totally ignored
