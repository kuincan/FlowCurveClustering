The data set may only be used non-commercially. We provide the inner and outer surface meshes over the cardiac cycle as well as 
path lines seeded at the inlet of the parent vessel.

For the optimal viewpoints, we provide the camera position (eye) and target (cen) in sphere coordinates. 
For each time point, the three best views are listed in the OptimalViewpoints.txt.
The used color maps for the surface mesh and the path lines are listed in the ColorMaps.txt.
